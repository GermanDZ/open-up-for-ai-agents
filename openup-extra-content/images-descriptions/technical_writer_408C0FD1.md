## Description

This image is a diagram illustrating the roles and responsibilities of a "Technical Writer." It uses a simple, clean aesthetic with a white background and clear, distinct icons and labels.

**High-Level Description:**

The diagram depicts a central figure, a "Technical Writer," and branches out to show the activities they "perform" and the types of documentation they are "responsible for." It effectively visualizes the scope of a technical writer's work in relation to product, support, and user documentation.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Central Figure (Left Side):**
   - An icon representing a person (a generic stick-figure-like shape, colored light orange/yellow) is positioned on the far left.
   - Directly below this icon, the text label "Technical Writer" clearly identifies the role.

2. **Relationships Branching from "Technical Writer":**
   - Two main lines originate from the "Technical Writer" figure, branching out to the right.
   - The upper branch is labeled "performs".
   - The lower branch is labeled "responsible for".

3. **Activities (Top Row, Right Side):**
   - Connected to the "performs" branch, there are three distinct icons arranged horizontally.
   - Each icon is a right-pointing chevron or arrow shape, colored light orange/yellow, similar to the "Technical Writer" icon.
   - From left to right, these icons are labeled:
     - "Develop Product Documentation"
     - "Develop Support Documentation"
     - "Develop User Documentation"
   - These represent the active tasks or processes performed by the technical writer.

4. **Outputs/Deliverables (Bottom Row, Right Side):**
   - Connected to the "responsible for" branch, there are three distinct icons arranged horizontally, directly below their corresponding "develop" activities.
   - Each icon represents a document (a rectangular sheet of paper with several horizontal lines to suggest text), colored light blue/gray with darker blue lines.
   - From left to right, these icons are labeled:
     - "Product Documentation"
     - "Support Documentation"
     - "User Documentation"
   - These represent the tangible outputs or deliverables for which the technical writer is accountable.

**Overall Meaning and Structure:**

The diagram illustrates a direct mapping: a Technical Writer performs actions (developing various types of documentation) and is responsible for the resulting artifacts (the actual documentation files). The layout creates a clear visual hierarchy, with the individual on the left and their functions and outputs fanning out to the right in a structured, easy-to-understand grid. The consistent use of icon types (chevron for actions, document for outputs, stick figure for role) reinforces the categories of information being presented.
