# Image Description: deployment_manager_3A2F7BCA.jpg

## Description

This image is a simple diagram illustrating a responsibility relationship between a role and a control mechanism. It features two distinct visual elements connected by a descriptive arrow.

On the left side of the diagram, there is a golden-orange stick-figure icon, commonly used to represent an actor or a person in diagrams like UML use case diagrams. Below this icon, the text label "Deployment Manager" is displayed, identifying the role.

On the right side of the diagram, there is a document icon, depicted as a sheet of paper with several horizontal lines on it, suggesting a list or text content. Below this icon, the text label "Release Controls" is displayed, identifying a set of controls or documentation.

Connecting the "Deployment Manager" (actor) on the left to the "Release Controls" (document) on the right is a single, straight horizontal line with an arrowhead pointing from left to right, towards "Release Controls". Above this connecting line, the text "responsible for" is written, explicitly stating the nature of the relationship.

In summary, the diagram visually represents that the "Deployment Manager" is "responsible for" "Release Controls". It's a clear, concise visual statement of accountability or ownership within a process or organizational structure.
