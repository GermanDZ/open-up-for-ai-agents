# Image Description: product_owner_1CADE89D.jpg

## Description

This image displays a simple, iconic representation, likely intended as a diagrammatic element such as a UML (Unified Modeling Language) actor.

**High-level Description:**

The image features a stylized, gold-colored stick figure icon positioned above the text "Product Owner" in black font. It is presented on a plain white background.

**Detailed Description:**

1. **Icon:** A two-dimensional, gold or light brown stick figure is depicted. It consists of a circular head and a body represented by a single, slightly angled rectangle that suggests a torso and legs. The figure has no distinct arms or facial features, maintaining a minimalist, abstract form.

2. **Text:** Directly below the stick figure, the words "Product Owner" are written in a standard sans-serif font, in black color. The text is centrally aligned under the icon.

3. **Arrangement:** The stick figure is vertically aligned above the text, forming a single conceptual unit.

4. **Background:** The entire graphic is set against a clean white background, providing high contrast and making the elements clearly visible.

5. **Contextual Inference:** Given the style, this icon is commonly used in software development diagrams, particularly in UML use case diagrams, to represent an actor or a role interacting with a system. The label "Product Owner" specifically identifies a key stakeholder role, often found in Agile methodologies, responsible for defining and prioritizing features for a product.
