## Description

This image is a simplified organizational or process diagram illustrating the responsibilities and actions associated with the "Process Engineer" role. It features a central actor connected to two types of related entities: actions performed and an artifact they are responsible for.

**High-level Description:**

The diagram depicts a "Process Engineer" role and its direct relationships. The Process Engineer is shown to perform two key activities: "Deploy the Process" and "Tailor the Process," and is also responsible for a "Project Defined Process."

**Detailed Description:**

1. **Central Actor/Role:**
   - On the left side of the diagram, there is a stylized icon representing a person or role. This icon is a solid, yellow-gold figure, resembling a simplified human silhouette.
   - Directly below this icon, it is labeled in black text as "**Process Engineer**". This signifies the main subject of the diagram, an individual or team holding this specific role.

2. **Relationships and Connections:**
   - Two distinct lines branch out from the "Process Engineer" icon, indicating different types of relationships.
   - The upper branch is labeled "**performs**" in black text. This line connects the Process Engineer to activities they execute.
   - The lower branch is labeled "**responsible for**" in black text. This line connects the Process Engineer to an output or artifact they oversee.

3. **Activities Performed:**
   - Connected via the "performs" branch, there are two identical icons, each representing an activity or task.
   - These icons are horizontal, yellow-gold, arrow-shaped boxes pointing to the right.
   - The first activity is labeled "**Deploy the Process**". This suggests the act of implementing or making a process operational.
   - The second activity is labeled "**Tailor the Process**". This implies adapting or customizing a process to specific needs or contexts.

4. **Artifact of Responsibility:**
   - Connected via the "responsible for" branch, there is a single icon representing a document or defined output.
   - This icon is a vertical, light blue rectangle with several horizontal lines inside, resembling a text document or a piece of paper with content.
   - It is labeled "**Project Defined Process**". This indicates that the Process Engineer is accountable for the creation, maintenance, or overall state of a process specifically defined for a project.

**Overall Meaning:**

The diagram effectively visualizes the scope of a Process Engineer's duties, outlining that they are actively involved in both the deployment and customization of processes, and they hold accountability for the official, documented process tailored for a given project. It's a simple yet clear representation of a role's functional boundaries and key deliverables within a project or organizational context.
