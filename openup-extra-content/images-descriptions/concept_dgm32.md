## Description

The image displays a pixel-art style golden key, presented horizontally.

**High-level description:**

A simple, illustrative golden key rendered in a pixelated fashion.

**Detailed description:**

The key is predominantly golden yellow, with a glossy or metallic sheen suggested by brighter highlights. It is oriented horizontally, with the bow (the handle) on the left and the blade and bit (the part that enters the lock) on the right.

The bow of the key is a simple, rounded shape, with a small, darker gray or black circular detail in its center, possibly representing a hole for a keyring or a decorative element. The shaft extends from the bow, leading to the bit. The bit of the key has a distinct, stepped pattern common for a traditional mechanical key, featuring a series of rectangular cutouts and projections.

The overall style is reminiscent of early video game graphics or retro digital art due to its pixelated edges and distinct color blocks. The lighting appears to come from above, creating a slight gradient on the key's surface and a subtle reflection.
