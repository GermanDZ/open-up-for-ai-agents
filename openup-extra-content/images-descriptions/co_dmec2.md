# Image Description: co_dmec2.png

## Description

The image displays a two-column diagram illustrating the mapping between "Design Mechanisms" and their corresponding "Implementation Mechanisms." A vertical dotted line visually separates the two columns.

**High-Level Description:**

The diagram presents a set of abstract design concepts or storage approaches on the left, and concrete implementation technologies or frameworks that realize those designs on the right. Each design mechanism is connected to its respective implementation mechanism by an arrow pointing from left to right.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

- **Left Column Header:** "Design Mechanisms" (underlined)
- **Right Column Header:** "Implementation Mechanisms" (underlined)
- **Separator:** A dotted vertical line runs down the center, dividing the "Design Mechanisms" from the "Implementation Mechanisms."

**Mappings (Design Mechanism → Implementation Mechanism):**

1. **Design Mechanism:** "In-memory storage"
   - **Implementation Mechanism:** "AVL Tree from Z-library"
   - **Relationship:** An arrow connects "In-memory storage" to "AVL Tree from Z-library," suggesting that an AVL Tree (likely referring to an Adelson-Velsky and Landis tree, a self-balancing binary search tree) from a "Z-library" is used to implement in-memory storage.

2. **Design Mechanism:** "Flash card"
   - **Implementation Mechanism:** "MyLittleCard"
   - **Relationship:** An arrow connects "Flash card" to "MyLittleCard," indicating that "MyLittleCard" is the implementation for a flash card mechanism.

3. **Design Mechanism:** "Binary file"
   - **Implementation Mechanism:** "UNIX"
   - **Relationship:** An arrow connects "Binary file" to "UNIX," implying that the UNIX operating system's file system or utilities are used for handling binary files.

4. **Design Mechanism:** "DBMS" (Database Management System)
   - **Implementation Mechanism:** "ObjectStorage"
   - **Relationship:** An arrow connects "DBMS" to "ObjectStorage," suggesting that a Database Management System is implemented using an "ObjectStorage" solution.

The overall purpose of the diagram is to clarify how high-level design choices are translated into specific technical implementations.
