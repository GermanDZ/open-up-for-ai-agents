## Description

This image is a simplified diagram, likely a snippet from a Use Case diagram or a similar architectural representation, illustrating a basic interaction between an actor and an action.

**High-level Description:**

The diagram shows a single actor labeled "Any Role" on the left, connected by a line labeled "performs" to a use case or activity symbol labeled "Request Change" on the right. It depicts a foundational relationship where a generic role initiates or carries out a specific action.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Left Element (Actor):** On the far left, there is a standard stick-figure symbol, typically representing an actor in UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams. This symbol has a light orange or golden yellow fill with a thin dark outline. Directly below this actor symbol, the text "Any Role" is displayed in black, sans-serif font, indicating the generic nature of the entity performing an action.

- **Connecting Element (Relationship):** A horizontal, thin black line extends from the right side of the "Any Role" actor towards the "Request Change" symbol. This line signifies a relationship or connection. Positioned centrally above this line, the word "performs" is written in black, sans-serif font. This label explicitly defines the nature of the interaction between the actor and the action.

- **Right Element (Use Case/Activity):** On the far right, there is a symbol resembling a horizontal capsule or an arrow pointing to the right, filled with the same light orange or golden yellow color as the actor, and outlined in dark thin lines. This shape often represents a use case or an activity in various diagramming notations. Below this symbol, the text "Request Change" is displayed in black, sans-serif font, clearly identifying the specific action or system functionality.

**Overall Context and Meaning:**

The diagram visually communicates that "Any Role" has the capability or responsibility to "Request Change." It's a fundamental representation of a user (or system) interaction with a functional aspect of a system, emphasizing the action rather than internal processes or detailed steps. The minimalist design with clear labels makes the relationship unambiguous.
