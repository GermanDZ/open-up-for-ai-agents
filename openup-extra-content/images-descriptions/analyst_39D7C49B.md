## Description

This image is a process diagram illustrating the tasks performed by an "Analyst" and the documents they are responsible for creating or managing. The diagram is laid out horizontally, with the central actor on the left and associated elements fanning out to the right.

**High-level Description:**

The diagram depicts an "Analyst" and their relationship to various activities and artifacts within a system development context. It categorizes the Analyst's contributions into actions they "perform" and documents they are "responsible for."

**Detailed Elements:**

1. **Actor:** On the far left, a stick figure icon, typically representing an actor in UML, is labeled "Analyst." The icon is colored in shades of light brown/gold.

2. **Relationships:**
   - Two black lines extend from the "Analyst" icon:
     - The upper line is labeled "performs" and points upwards and to the right, connecting to a row of activities.
     - The lower line is labeled "responsible for" and points downwards and to the right, connecting to a row of documents/artifacts.

3. **Activities (Performed by Analyst):**
   Connected via the "performs" relationship, there are four elements represented by horizontal gold chevron or flag-like icons. These likely represent specific process steps or activities. From left to right, they are labeled:
   - "Detail System-Wide Requirements"
   - "Detail Use-Case Scenarios"
   - "Develop Technical Vision"
   - "Identify and Outline Requirements"

4. **Documents/Artifacts (Analyst is Responsible For):**
   Connected via the "responsible for" relationship, there are five elements represented by document icons (a sheet of paper with lines, implying text content). These likely represent deliverables or output documents. From left to right, they are labeled:
   - "Glossary"
   - "System-Wide Requirements"
   - "Use Case"
   - "Use-Case Model"
   - "Vision"

The diagram effectively maps the role of an Analyst to both the actions they undertake and the key documentation they contribute to in a project. The visual language suggests a conceptual or high-level overview of their involvement, likely within a requirements engineering or early design phase.
