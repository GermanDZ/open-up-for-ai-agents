# Image Description: Construction Phase_BD0D5748_Activity.jpeg

## Description

This image depicts a two-stage process or transition, illustrated with two distinct icons and accompanying text labels, connected by a right-pointing arrow. The overall background is white.

On the left side of the image:

There is an icon representing a house or building. The roof of the building is red, and the lower section (walls/foundation) is a light blue-grey. Below and slightly overlapping this building icon, there is a dark blue circular arrow, suggesting a cycle, refresh, or iteration.

Below this icon, the text label reads: "Construction Iteration [1..n]". The "[1..n]" indicates a variable number of iterations.

In the center of the image:

A simple black arrow points from left to right, connecting the first entity to the second.

On the right side of the image:

There is another icon, also representing a house or building, identical in structure and color (red roof, light blue-grey lower section) to the one on the left. However, this icon has a prominent, thick vertical red line that bisects the house, extending from its roofline downwards through its base. This line visually marks a distinct point or boundary.

Below this icon, the text label reads: "Initial Operational Capability Milestone".

In summary, the image illustrates a transition from a phase of "Construction Iteration" (which can happen multiple times) to an "Initial Operational Capability Milestone," represented by a cyclical building icon transitioning to a building icon with a red vertical marker. This suggests a progression from an iterative development phase to a specific, marked achievement or release point.
