## Description

This image is a monochrome diagram illustrating the concept of a single individual, "Charlie," fulfilling multiple roles within a system, specifically "Depot Manager" and "Depot Staff." The diagram uses simple black-and-white graphics and text.

On the left side of the diagram, an icon representing "Charlie" is displayed. This icon is a black silhouette of a person, seemingly operating or standing beside a piece of material handling equipment, possibly a pallet jack or a forklift, which is next to a rectangular object that could be a pallet or crate. Below this silhouette, the name "Charlie" is written in plain text.

From "Charlie" on the left, two distinct horizontal arrows extend towards the right. Each arrow is accompanied by a text label describing Charlie's role.
- The upper arrow is labeled "Charlie as depot manager" and points to the upper stick figure on the right.
- The lower arrow is labeled "Charlie as depot staff" and points to the lower stick figure on the right.

On the right side of the diagram, there is a large, open rectangular box, which typically denotes a system boundary in UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams. Inside this box, two stick figures are depicted vertically, representing actors in a system.
- The upper stick figure has the label "Depot Manager" positioned directly below it.
- The lower stick figure has the label "Depot Staff" positioned directly below it.

The overall meaning conveyed by the diagram is that Charlie, a single physical individual with an implied real-world occupation (operating depot equipment), can assume or be associated with two different functional roles within a system: that of a "Depot Manager" and that of "Depot Staff." This is a common way to illustrate how a person can have different responsibilities or permissions depending on the context or their assigned role in an organizational or software system. The use of stick figures and a boundary box suggests a conceptual or architectural view, likely related to system design or role-based access control.
