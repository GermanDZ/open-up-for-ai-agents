## Description

This image is a simple UML (Unified Modeling Language) Use Case Diagram illustrating the "User Login" process.

**High-level Description:**

The diagram shows three main components: a "User" actor, a "User Login" use case, and a "SecuritySystem" actor. Arrows indicate the flow of interaction, with the "User" initiating the "User Login" use case, which in turn interacts with the "SecuritySystem."

**Detailed Description:**

1. **Actors:**
   - On the left side of the diagram, there is a stick figure labeled "User" positioned below it. This represents an external entity (a human user) that interacts with the system.
   - On the right side of the diagram, there is another stick figure labeled "SecuritySystem" positioned below it. This represents another external system or component that the "User Login" use case interacts with.

2. **Use Case:**
   - In the center of the diagram, an oval shape is present, which is the standard symbol for a use case. Inside this oval, the text "User Login" is clearly visible. This represents a distinct unit of functionality provided by the system, as perceived by external actors.

3. **Relationships (Associations):**
   - An arrow points from the "User" actor to the "User Login" use case. This arrow is a solid line with an open arrowhead pointing towards the use case. This indicates that the "User" actor initiates or participates in the "User Login" use case.
   - Another arrow points from the "User Login" use case to the "SecuritySystem" actor. This arrow is also a solid line with an open arrowhead pointing towards the "SecuritySystem." This implies that the "User Login" use case communicates with or relies on the "SecuritySystem" to perform its function (e.g., for authentication or authorization).

**Meaning and Flow:**

The diagram illustrates a straightforward scenario where a "User" wants to log into a system. To achieve this, the user interacts with the "User Login" functionality. During this login process, the system, specifically the "User Login" use case, interacts with an external "SecuritySystem," presumably to verify the user's credentials or manage access. This diagram highlights the primary actors involved and the central use case for authentication within a system context.
