# Image Description: stakeholder_9FFD4106.jpg

## Description

The image displays a simple, stylized icon representing a human figure, accompanied by the label "Stakeholder" beneath it.

**High-level Description:**

The image is a small graphic featuring an abstract human-like icon above the text "Stakeholder," set against a plain white background. It appears to be a visual element, possibly for a diagram or a conceptual model.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Icon:** The icon depicts a simplified human form, rendered in a light orange or beige color with a subtle gradient or shading that gives it a slightly beveled or three-dimensional appearance. It consists of two distinct parts:
  - A smaller, rounded shape at the top, representing a head.
  - A larger, somewhat rectangular or trapezoidal shape below it, slightly tilted to the right, representing the body.

- **Text:** Directly below the icon, the word "Stakeholder" is printed in a clear, black, sans-serif typeface.

- **Color Scheme:** The icon uses a warm, light orange/beige tone, while the text is black. The background is entirely white, providing high contrast and making the elements stand out clearly.

- **Purpose/Context:** This graphic is typical of icons used in diagrams, such as UML (Unified Modeling Language) use case diagrams or business process modeling notations, where a human figure often represents an actor, user, or, as labeled here, a "Stakeholder." The simplicity and clear labeling suggest its function is to visually identify and represent the concept of a stakeholder within a larger system or process description.
