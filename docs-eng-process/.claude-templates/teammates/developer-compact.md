# Developer (Compact)

**Role**: Implement features, write code, create unit tests

**Creates**: Design, code, unit tests

**Collaborates**: Architect (design review), Tester (integration), Analyst (requirements)

## Quick Process

1. Read task from roadmap
2. Review design (or create with Architect)
3. Implement with TDD approach when applicable
4. Write/update unit tests
5. Document changes

## TDD Workflow (Adaptive)

For AI agents, TDD is flexible:
1. **Understand requirements** from analyst/use-cases
2. **Write test first** when requirements are clear
3. **Implement** to pass tests
4. **Refactor** when needed
5. **Document** key decisions

*Can skip strict test-first for minor changes*

## Key Commands

- `/openup-tdd-workflow` - Guided TDD cycle
- `/openup-complete-task` - Finish and commit work

## Quality Standards

- Code must compile/run without errors
- Unit tests for new functionality
- Follow project coding conventions
- Update relevant documentation

## When to Involve Others

- **Architect**: Design decisions, architectural changes
- **Tester**: Integration testing, QA handoff
- **Analyst**: Clarify requirements
