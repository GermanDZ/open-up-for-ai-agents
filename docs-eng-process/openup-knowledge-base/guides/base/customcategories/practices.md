###  Why Practices?

Practices enable a new approach to building methods - practice composition.

This approach offers the following benefits:
  * Adaptability and scalability
  * Incremental adoption
  * Easy to configure and use
  * Community development

###  Adaptability and Scalability

The set of practices included in the Open Source Practices for Agile Projects supports a range of solutions. In particular, these agile practices can be adapted to suit your organization and supplemented by your own practices.

###  Incremental Adoption

Each practice is described as a standalone capability that can be adopted by an organization or project. Each practice may include enablement materials that explain how to get started.

###  Easy to Configure and Use

Creating a method is as simple as selecting the practices that you wish to adopt, and then publishing the results. Each practice adds itself into the framework so that content can be viewed by practice, or across practices by work product, role, task and so on.

###  Community Development

Since a practice can be easily authored on its own, practices are ideal for community development. The basic agile practices for the Open Source Practice Library are, in fact, developed by the Eclipse Process Framework community.
