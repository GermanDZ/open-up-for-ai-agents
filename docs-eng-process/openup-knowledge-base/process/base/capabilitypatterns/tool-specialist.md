Staffing

Skills|  An individual playing this role needs to have a broad set of skills. This includes an understanding of the underlying processes used by the project, and for this training might be required prior to project startup. General systematic analysis skills are beneficial when comparing and selecting tools for the project. Knowledge of the development platform\(s\) is required, on networking issues in particular. A person acting as this role also needs good communication skills and a 'service-minded' attitude, since she or he is likely to be a support contact point for the project members, on installation and other tool troubleshooting issues.

Assignment Approaches|  This role can be assigned in the following ways:
  * Assign one or more staff members to perform both this role and developer roles. This is a commonly adopted approach, especially in small-to-mid-sized teams, and capitalizes on the common development skills that developer role shares with this role.
  * Assign one staff member to perform this role only. This is a commonly adopted approach and is particularly suitable for large teams or smaller teams where effective tool support and process automation is a key aspect of the projects development plan.
