Main Description

This task represents the distribution of communiques that were prepared beforehand as part of the release communications artifact. Although the development team is responsible for preparing the communications, the responsibility for sending the communiques normally is assigned to the deployment engineer, if that is the organizational protocol.
---

Steps

Validate the communiques | Ensure that the communiques designated for this release are correct, complete, and reflect all the stakeholder groups that must be informed.
---

Send release communications

Using a pre-planned script, send the communiques in the manner designated in the [Artifact: Release Communications](../../../practice-general/production_release/workproducts/release-communications-4.md). Most of the time, the preferred communication mechanism will be by email, but other methods could include beeper notification, telephone calls, a posting to an internal release website, live or pre-recorded presentations by senior management, etc.
---

Validate communications were received

If the communiques were sent by email, it may be prudent to request a receipt of delivery to ensure that the notices were received by the intended audience.
