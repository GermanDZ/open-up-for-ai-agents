Staffing

Skills|  A person filling the this role should have these skills:
  * Knowledge of testing approaches and techniques
  * Diagnostic and problem-solving skills
  * Knowledge of the system or application being tested \(desirable\)
  * Knowledge of networking and system architecture \(desirable\)

Where automated testing is required, consider requiring these additional qualifications:
  * Training in the appropriate use of test automation tools
  * Experience using test automation tools
  * Programming skills
  * Debugging and diagnostic skills
**Note:**
Specific skill requirements vary depending on the type of testing that you are conducting. For example, the skills needed to successfully use system load-testing automation tools are different from those needed for the automation of system functional testing.

Assignment Approaches|  This role can be assigned in the following ways:
  * Assign one or more testing staff members to perform this role. This is a fairly standard approach and is particularly suitable for small teams, as well as for teams of any size where the team is made up of an experienced group of testers of relatively equal skill levels.
  * Assign one or more testing staff members to perform only this role. This works well in large teams. It is also useful to separate responsibilities when some of the testing staff has more test automation experience than other team members.
  * Assign one \(or more\) team member who is already playing other role in the project to be responsible for the testing of some part of the system's capabilities. The team member must have the appropriate test skills.
