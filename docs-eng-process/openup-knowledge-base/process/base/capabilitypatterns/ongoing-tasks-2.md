Description

This activity includes a task for requesting changes. This task may occur any time during the lifecycle in response to an observed defect, a desired enhancement, or a change request. It is not planned, which means that it does not appear as a scheduled activity on the project plan, iteration plan, or work items list. Nevertheless, it is a critical activity that must be performed to ensure project success, because your environment is not static.  Any role may perform this task, however the most common sources of [Change Requests](../../../practice-technical/continuous_integration/guidances/concepts/change-requests.md) are stakeholders \(enhancement requests and change requests\) and testers \(defect reports\).
