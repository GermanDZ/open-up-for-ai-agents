Main Description

Often, a trainer will deliver training to end users; rarely will the development team deliver training because they are busy developing additional features for this or other systems. If a trainer is not available, the product owner might have to train the end users.  End user training usually consists of presentation slides, job aids, hands-on labs and exercises, or workshops that integrate these methods into an environment that the end users can understand and relate to.

Steps

Validate user training logistics |  Before actually delivering the training to end users, ensure that you have all the necessary components of the training course, including:
  * Presentation slides
  * Handouts
  * Training aids
  * Hands-on labs and/or exercises
  * Quizzes or tests
  * Feedback and/or instructor assessment forms

Ensure the classes have been scheduled correctly and attendees have been identified. Verify that the facilities where you will deliver the training have been properly booked and are furnished to accommodate the training content and audience. If possible, send a reminder notice to the attendees several days \(or a week\) before the delivery date.
---

Prepare for user training delivery

Review the training materials so that you are familiar with them. If you encounter any areas in which you are unsure or tentative about, engage experts from the development team or program who can help you understand the material. Then, update the training materials accordingly and create instructor notes to help you remember key points as you deliver the training. Instructor notes that you author will not only help you, but they might assist other instructors in the future who have not had the benefit of working with the development team or program.
---

Deliver user training and gather feedback

On the prescribed day\(s\) and time\(s\), deliver the training as planned. When each course is completed, solicit feedback from the attendees on the course material, its organization and flow, the learning objectives, how well the instructor delivered the content, and whether the course met their expectations.
---

Provide feedback to the program level

Consolidate the feedback from the courses delivered and provide it to the program manager or their delegate for review.
