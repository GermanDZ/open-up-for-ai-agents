Tailoring

Impact of not having| Without this artifact, it is difficult to determine all of the relationships between actors and use cases. It is also difficult to gain an understanding of how different use cases relate.
---|---
Reasons for not needing|  You might not need this requirement if the overall set of use cases is small and has no complex relationships.  You also might not need a use-case model if you use an alternative approach to document functional requirements.
Representation Options|  Representation options include reports and diagrams from UML modeling tools, graphical representations created by using drawing tools, and drawings on whiteboards. Most of the information in the use-case model is captured in the use-case specifications.
