 This artifact is a sorted list of known and open risks to the project, sorted in order of importance and associated with specific mitigation or contingency actions.

Main Description

This list identifies, in decreasing order of priority, all the [risks](../../../core/common/guidances/termdefinitions/risk-1.md) associated to a project. It serves as a focal point for project activities, and is the basis around which iterations are organized.  See [Concept: Risk](../../../core/common/guidances/concepts/risk.md) for more details.

Key Considerations

This list should capture the critical and serious risks. If you find this list extending beyond 20 items, carefully consider whether they are really serious risks. Tracking more than 20 risks is an onerous task.
---

Tailoring

Impact of not having| If risks are not identified, then the required mitigation strategies will not be in place, and any adverse events that do occur on a project will have to be dealt with in an ad-hoc manner. Undocumented risks that do occur are also more likely to impact the overall schedule and quality of the solution
---|---
Reasons for not needing|  Unless there are no risks, or very minimal ones, there is no reason not to produce this artifact.
Representation Options|  A representation option for the risk list is to capture it as a section in the coarse-grained plan for the project. This means the coarse-grained plan has to be revisited constantly as you update risks. The fine-grained plans will contain only the tasks that you will be doing to mitigate risks in the short term.
