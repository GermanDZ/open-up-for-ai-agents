Description

This activity takes place at the beginning of the first iteration, when the project starts. The goal of this activity is to establish the vision for both the project and the project plan at a high level of granularity.  The people in the roles involved at this time collaborate to perform this activity:
  * The [Analyst](../../../core/role/roles/analyst-6.md) and [Stakeholder](../../../core/role/roles/stakeholder-6.md) roles work together to define the [vision](../../../core/common/workproducts/vision.md) for the project, capturing the customer needs and features for the system under development. Needs and features are captured to the extent required to reach agreement about the scope of the project.
  * The project manager \(collaborating and reaching agreement with the development team and stakeholders\) proposes a high-level [project plan](../../../practice-management/release_planning/workproducts/project-plan-4.md) that includes the [milestones](../../../practice-management/risk_value_lifecycle/guidances/concepts/phase-milestones.md) for the four phases, and time-boxed iterations for each phase. This plan, along with the allocation of staff to the project, evolves throughout the phases and defines the pace of the project.
