 This roadmap describes how to adopt the Concurrent Testing practice.

Main Description

###  How to adopt this practice

The following is a list of points that you need to consider when you adopt this practice.  Process scope:
  * **Test coverage:** component, feature, and subsystem, or all three
  * **Focus on the main elements:** tasks, artifacts, guidelines

Team impact:
  * **Team composition:** Testers are part of the team, not external resources that are involved only at specific points.
  * **Roles:** This practice also needs to be adopted by developers to make sure that they provide tested components.
  * **Skills:** Testers need to adopt a more technical skill set, and developers can also fill the Tester role.

Development approach:
  * Set a goal of stable builds that can be tested from end-to-end.
  * Provide smaller increments of functionality.
  * Institute "walkthroughs" to determine whether a micro-increment is correct.
  * Build and test frequently throughout an iteration.
  * Make passing automated tests the team's definition of "finished" for a requirement.

Reach a pattern where the team continuously develops micro-increments, tests them, and then regression tests the product throughout the day. Obviously, this involves a high degree of regression test automation. Achieving this level of automation requires the concerted effort of the whole team, across all the levels of testing, with automated unit, integration, system, and acceptance tests.
