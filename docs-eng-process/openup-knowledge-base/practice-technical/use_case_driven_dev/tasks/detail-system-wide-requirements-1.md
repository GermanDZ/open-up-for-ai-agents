Steps

Detail system-wide requirements |  Some system-wide requirements might need to be clarified or described in more detail. New requirements may be discovered while the use cases and scenarios are detailed, and new requirements may have been submitted as change requests. Collaborate with stakeholders to capture, refine and validate those requirements that will have an impact on near term, planned work or are deemed architecturally significant.
---

Detail glossary terms

Review the system-wide requirements and collaborate with stakeholders to ensure that you define newly discovered domain terms, or ambiguous terms properly in the glossary. If your understanding of the domain has improved, refine existing glossary terms.
---

Achieve concurrence

Review the detailed system-wide requirements with relevant stakeholders and the development team to ensure consistency with the agreed vision. Assess quality and identify any required changes.
---

Key Considerations

To avoid unnecessary rework, only those requirements that are scheduled for implementation in the near term \(in the next iteration or two\) must be detailed.
