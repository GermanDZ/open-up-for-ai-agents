Purpose

Establishing and maintaining a shared vision of the problem being solved \(stakeholder needs\) and the high-level properties of the proposed product \(product features\) reduces the risk associated with stakeholder and market acceptance by aligning expectations.  Unfortunately, misunderstandings and miscommunication about the product strategy often lead the development team to develop a system that fails to meet stakeholders' needs and vision.  It is essential that the development team and stakeholders share the same expectations. The product [Vision](../../../../core/common/workproducts/vision.md) identifies the stakeholders, provides a common understanding of the problem being addressed, captures the high-level stakeholder needs and project constraints, and provides the background and context for requirements that will be detailed later. A shared vision serves as input for communicating the fundamental "what and why" for the project, and provides a strategy against which all future decisions must be validated.  Establishing and maintaining a shared vision is also essential for planning and monitoring the scope of the development effort. The product Vision establishes the long-term vision for the product, a vision that typically spans several releases, and provides the information required for cost-benefit analysis and prioritization of work.

How to read this practice

The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what it is in it and how it is organized.  Review the template for the [Vision](../../../../core/common/workproducts/vision.md) to understand the information it captures. Then review the task [Develop Technical Vision](../../tasks/develop-technical-vision-1.md) to see the steps describing "what" needs to be performed to capture this information. Associated guidelines provide more detailed information on "how" to perform the task. Finally, the associated checklist provides a means to verify that you have captured all of the required information.  For step-by-step instructions on how to adopt this practice, see [How to Adopt the Shared Vision Practice](../roadmaps/how-to-adopt-the-shared-vision-practice.md).
