Description

Main Description|  A project process typically describes or references the following items:
  * what organizational processes and policies must be adhered to.
  * what standard process, if any, is being adopted by the project.
  * any tailoring of the standard process, or deviations from policy mandates.
  * rationale for tailoring and deviations.
  * approvals for deviations.
  * which work products are reviewed at which milestones, and their level of completion.
  * guidelines and information that the project wants to use in addition to the information contained in the main. process
  * what reviews will be performed, and their level of formality.
  * what approvals are required, by whom, and when.

Tailoring

Impact of not having|
All teams have a process, although it may be ad-hoc. A defined process helps team members understand their responsibilities and capture lessons learned. A team that follows an ad-hoc process is at risk of being confused in terms of responsibilities, may miss opportunities to learn from experience, and is at risk of violating organizational process requirements.
---|---
Reasons for not needing| An ad-hoc process may be acceptable when there are no organizational process requirements, the team members understand their responsibilities and are comfortable working without a defined process.
Representation Options| Processes can be captured informally in documents, formally captured in a Method Composer configuration, or specified by configuring tools. Typically a project will use a combination of these: start with a Method Composer configuration, create a document to describe variations from this configuration, and configure tools to support the process being followed.
