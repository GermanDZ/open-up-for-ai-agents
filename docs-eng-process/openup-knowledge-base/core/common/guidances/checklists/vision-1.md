Check Items

The problem behind the problem has been fully explored |  Make sure that you have found the root cause of the stakeholder's problem or need. Often, stakeholders define solutions rather than stating the problem that they are experiencing or the pain they are experiencing. Subsequently, they may not have identified the problem correctly or the correct solution for it.  For example, "We can't support customers who want to buy online" is better than "We need an on-line purchasing system".
---

The problem statement is correctly formulated

Make sure that you have agreement on the problem to be solved.
---

The list of stakeholders is complete and correct

Make sure you didn't miss any stakeholders. If you did, you probably do not yet have all of the perspectives that you need to consider.
---

Everyone agrees on the definition of the system boundaries

Define what is **in** and what is **out** of system boundaries. This is a critical step in defining the scope of work.
---

Constraints on the system have been sufficiently explored

Don't forget about the non-functional requirements and constraints. These are often the largest cost of development.
---

All kinds of constraints, including political, economic, and environmental, have been covered.

These non-technical constraints often lead to problems later.
---

All key features of the system been identified and defined

Do a completeness check, comparing the features with the problem statement, to make sure that you didn't miss a critical feature.
---

The features solve the identified problems

Are all the features really necessary? Perhaps you can reduce the scope.
---

The features are consistent with the identified constraints

Check that conflicting requirements do not exist. If you find conflicts, resolve them now.
---

Someone unfamiliar with the project can understand the project objectives

The purpose of the Vision document is to describe the objectives of the project in terms that non-technical people, who are not closely involved with the project, can understand.
