 This discipline explains how to design and implement a technical solution that conforms to the architecture and supports the requirements.

Main Description

The purpose of this discipline is to:
  * Transform the requirements into a design of the system-to-be
  * Adapt the design to match the implementation environment
  * Build the system incrementally
  * Verify that the technical units used to build the system work as specified

With each iteration, the tasks in this discipline will evolve an ever more-capable and ever more-stable build.  When working on the system, developers will both use and be constrained by the architecture.  This discipline is related to the other disciplines in the following ways:
  * The [Requirements](requirements-2.md) discipline defines what will be designed and implemented.
  * The [Architecture](architecture-1.md) discipline organizes and constrains the design and implementation.
  * The [Test](test-1.md) discipline validates that the system built meets the requirements.
  * The [Project Management](project-management-1.md) discipline plans what functionality will be implemented in each iteration and provides the mechanisms to manage changes to the system.
