 This is an example of an iteration plan for iteration 5 for a small team. In this example, the team has chosen not to list work items in the iteration plan. Instead, the team will search the work items list for work items assigned to iteration 5. This is the preferred solution when work items are managed in a tool that provides basic search capabilities.
