Main Description

The following are typical activities or key considerations when tailoring any given process area. You can use these considerations in advance, to decide what to tailor for a given process area, or as a checklist to confirm that you've done all the tailoring that makes sense for the given process area. Additional process area-specific guidelines may also be available.  Identify policies and procedures you are required to follow, and make sure team is made aware of them.  Capture glossary of terms specific to this process area \(project-wide glossary or specific-area process\)  Capture definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations  Capture references \(documents important to this process area\)  Make sure organization, responsibilities and interfaces are described  Make sure the right tools and infrastructure are available and the team knows how to use them  Be aware of available metrics and reports and decide which ones you will use and how often.  Determine that team has the training and resources, including personnel that they require.
