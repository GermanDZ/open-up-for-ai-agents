Main Description

The choice of testing tools is often affected by the architecture, including the technology choices made by the project, and the software that the system needs to interface with. In some cases you may build custom tools.  You will want tool support for the following:
  * test management
  * test automation
  * simulation of external interfaces
  * simulation of different test environments
  * performance testing
  * load testing
  * vulnerability testing
  * static and dynamic analysis
  * manual testing
