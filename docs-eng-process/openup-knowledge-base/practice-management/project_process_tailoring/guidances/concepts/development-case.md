Main Description

The Development Case is used to document the results of tailoring a process. It provides a mechanism for describing how a project has tailored a process for their specific project.  In general, the development case typically refers to a standard process, often defined at an organization level, and then describes how that process has been tailored or specialized for the project. This typically includes:
  * Information about how the process varies from the standard process, and why \(typically by identifying work products added or removed from the process\)
  * What work products are reviewed at which milestones, and their level of completion
  * References to guidelines and information that the project wants to use in addition to the information contained in the main process.
  * What reviews will be performed, and their level of formality.
  * What approvals are required, by whom, and when.

The development case also includes information on what was tailored and why.
