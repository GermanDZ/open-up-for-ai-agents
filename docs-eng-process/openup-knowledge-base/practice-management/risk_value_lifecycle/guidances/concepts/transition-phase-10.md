Main Description

The purpose in this phase is to ensure that the software is ready for delivery to users.  There are objectives for the Transition phase that help you to fine-tune functionality, performance, and overall quality of the beta product from the end of the previous phase [\[KRO03\]](./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#KRO03):

  1. **Beta test to validate that user expectations are met.** This typically requires some fine-tuning activities, such as bug-fixing and making enhancements for performance and usability.
  2. **Achieve stakeholder concurrence that deployment is complete.** This may involve various levels of tests for product acceptance, including formal and informal tests and beta tests.
  3. **Improve future project performance through lessons learned.** Document lessons learned and improve the process and tool environment for the project.

####  Key considerations

The Transition phase can include running old and new systems in parallel, migrating data, training users, and adjusting business processes.  The number of iterations in the Transition phase varies from one iteration for a simple system requiring primarily minor bug fixing, to many iterations for a complex system, involving addition of features and performing activities to make the business transition from using the old system to using the new system.  When the Transition phase objectives are met, the project can be closed. For some products, the end of the current project lifecycle may coincide with the beginning of the next lifecycle, leading to the next generation of the same product.
