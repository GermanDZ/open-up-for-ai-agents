## Description

The image displays a stylized icon representing an email or message.

**High-level description:**

The image is a graphic icon of an open email envelope with five horizontal lines to its left, suggesting incoming or outgoing communication.

**Detailed description:**

The central element of the icon is an email envelope, rendered with a slightly three-dimensional and glossy appearance. The body of the envelope is a light, muted beige or off-white color, outlined with a thinner, darker golden-brown border. The flap of the envelope is depicted as open and raised upwards, revealing a contrasting golden-brown interior.

To the immediate left of the envelope, five parallel, thin horizontal lines extend outwards. These lines are a light blue or white color and are evenly spaced. They appear to taper slightly as they approach the envelope, creating a visual sense of motion or flow directed towards the envelope. This element typically symbolizes an incoming message, sending a message, or general electronic communication activity.

The icon is set against a seemingly plain, possibly transparent or white background, which emphasizes the subject. The overall color palette is subdued, combining earth tones (beige, golden-brown) with cool tones (light blue/white for the lines). The design is characteristic of a user interface element used to represent email, messaging services, or notification features in digital applications.
