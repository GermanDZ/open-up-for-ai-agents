# Image Description: disciplines_48.png

## Description

This image displays a stylized icon, primarily illustrating a conceptual flow or process.

**High-Level Description:**

The icon depicts a simplified diagram composed of three distinct shapes—two blue rectangles and one yellow chevron—interconnected by lines, suggesting a sequence of steps or a data transformation process. It has a glossy, three-dimensional appearance, commonly found in user interface elements or system diagrams.

**Detailed Elements and Structure:**

1. **Top-Left Blue Rectangle:** This is a light blue, horizontally oriented rectangle with a subtle 3D effect, making it appear like a raised block or cuboid. It has soft gradients and a slight sheen, suggesting a glossy surface. It is positioned in the upper-left quadrant of the icon.

2. **Top-Right Blue Rectangle:** Similar in style and color to the top-left rectangle, this second light blue, glossy cuboid is also horizontally oriented. It is positioned to the right of the first rectangle and slightly below it, maintaining the same 3D appearance.

3. **Yellow Chevron/Arrow:** Positioned in the center and slightly below the line connecting the two blue rectangles, this shape is a vibrant yellow right-pointing chevron or an arrow-like polygon. It also features a glossy, 3D effect with gradients and highlights, indicating depth. Its pointed tip faces towards the right blue rectangle.

4. **Connecting Lines:** Two dark grey or black lines with a slight shadow effect establish connections between the shapes:
   - One line originates from the bottom edge, specifically the bottom-left corner, of the top-left blue rectangle and extends downwards, then makes a right turn to connect to the left-facing V-notch of the yellow chevron.
   - Another line extends from the right-pointing tip of the yellow chevron and turns upwards to connect to the bottom-left corner of the top-right blue rectangle.

**Implied Meaning:**

The arrangement of the shapes and lines strongly suggests a flow or transformation. The blue rectangles could represent states, data containers, modules, or process steps, while the yellow chevron, given its arrow-like nature, signifies an action, a transition, processing, or a decision point that moves from one state/step to another. The overall visual implies a sequence: input/start (top-left blue rectangle) -> processing/transformation (yellow chevron) -> output/result/next step (top-right blue rectangle).
