**Alt Text:** Trainer

## Description

This image displays a simple, schematic diagram, likely a snippet from a UML Use Case diagram, showing an actor and two use cases related by an action. The background is white.

**Detailed breakdown:**

1. **Actor**: On the left side of the diagram, there is a standard UML actor symbol. This symbol is an orange-beige colored stick figure with a head, body, and two lines for arms and legs, giving it a slightly three-dimensional, embossed appearance. Below this stick figure, centered, is the label "Trainer" in black sans-serif text.

2. **Relationship**: Extending horizontally to the right from the "Trainer" actor is a solid black line. Above this line, centered, is the label "performs" in black sans-serif text. This indicates an association where the "Trainer" performs certain actions.

3. **Use Cases**: To the right of the "performs" relationship, there are two distinct symbols, arranged horizontally, representing use cases.
   - **First Use Case**: The first use case is an orange-beige colored shape resembling a horizontally oriented, elongated hexagon or an arrow pointing to the right. It has a slight three-dimensional, embossed effect. Below this shape, stacked in two lines, is the label "Deliver end user" on the first line and "Training" on the second line, both in black sans-serif text and centered.
   - **Second Use Case**: To the right of the first use case, separated by some empty space, is a second use case symbol identical in shape and color to the first one. Below this second shape, stacked in two lines, is the label "Deliver Support" on the first line and "Training" on the second line, both in black sans-serif text and centered.

**Overall Meaning**: The diagram illustrates that a "Trainer" actor "performs" the actions of "Deliver end user Training" and "Deliver Support Training". This suggests the Trainer is responsible for these two training-related use cases within a system or process.
