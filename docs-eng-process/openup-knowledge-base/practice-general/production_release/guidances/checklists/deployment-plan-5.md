Main Description

By answering a set of generic questions \(who, what, when, where, why, and how\), deployment planning can go a long way to make a release a satisfying experience. Some questions to be considered are indicated by the check items below:
---

Check Items

Who are the end users of the features to be released? | Do those end users require any special training?
---

What features must be deployed?

What features will make this release valuable to the end user community? What components are included in the release package?
---

When do the features need to be available?

When must the deployment be completed and tested?
---

Where are the end users located?

Are end users distributed or in one location, and are their infrastructure configurations the same or different?
---

Why is the release taking place?

Is the deployment needed to resolve an issue or is it required to provide new functionality that has been requested?
---

Who will support the release after it is deployed?

Do support personnel have all the information and training necessary to provide quality support?
---

When is the release "done?"

How will the team know that the release was successful and when the deployment is finished?
