# How to Work

This document provides minimal orientation. For detailed procedures, see [agent-workflow.md](agent-workflow.md).

## Process Overview

This repository uses **OpenUP** (Open Unified Process), a lean, iterative methodology with four phases:

1. **Inception** - Define scope, vision, and feasibility
2. **Elaboration** - Establish architecture baseline
3. **Construction** - Build the system incrementally
4. **Transition** - Deploy to users

Each phase contains one or more iterations, and each iteration delivers incremental value.

## Disciplines

OpenUP organizes work into disciplines:

- **Requirements** - Elicit, analyze, specify, validate requirements
- **Architecture** - Create and evolve software architecture
- **Development** - Design and implement the solution
- **Test** - Provide feedback through testing
- **Deployment** - Plan and deploy the solution
- **Project Management** - Coach, facilitate, and support the team
- **Environment** - Customize process and tools

## Iteration Lifecycle

Each iteration follows a cycle:

1. **Plan** - Select work items, assign to team members
2. **Implement** - Design, code, test (micro-increments)
3. **Assess** - Review results, demonstrate to stakeholders
4. **Adapt** - Adjust plans based on feedback
