## Description

This image is a two-dimensional chart titled "Project Lifecycle" displayed within a light blue border with rounded corners. The title is prominently featured in a dark blue banner at the top of the chart.

The chart illustrates the evolution of "Risk" and "Value" across four distinct phases of a project lifecycle, presented as vertical columns from left to right:
1. **Inception**
2. **Elaboration**
3. **Construction**
4. **Transition**

The background color behind the curves changes across these phases, starting with a pale blue-grey in "Inception," transitioning to a light yellow through "Elaboration" and "Construction," and becoming a slightly deeper yellow in "Transition." Vertical dashed lines further subdivide the "Construction" phase into several smaller segments.

Two prominent curved lines are plotted against these phases:

- **Risk Curve:** This curve is colored **red** and represents "Risk." It starts at a very high level in the "Inception" phase, indicating high initial risk. It then declines sharply through the "Elaboration" phase, continues to decrease at a more moderate pace through "Construction," and flattens out at a very low level by the "Transition" phase. The word "Risk" is written in red text near this curve in the "Elaboration" phase.

- **Value Curve:** This curve is colored **green** and represents "Value." It begins at a very low level in the "Inception" phase, suggesting minimal value at the project's start. It gradually increases through "Inception" and "Elaboration," then accelerates its upward trend significantly through "Construction" and "Transition," reaching a very high level by the end of the "Transition" phase. The word "Value" is written in green text near this curve in the "Construction" phase.

The two curves intersect roughly within the "Elaboration" phase, or very early into the "Construction" phase. At this intersection point, the diminishing risk and increasing value appear to be of similar magnitude.

In summary, the diagram visually conveys that as a project progresses through its lifecycle, the initial high risk associated with the "Inception" and "Elaboration" phases steadily decreases, while the overall value generated by the project consistently increases, culminating in high value and minimal risk by the "Transition" phase.
