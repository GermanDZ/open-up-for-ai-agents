## Description

The image displays a stylized icon representing a file folder containing a document.

**High-level description:**

A glossy, three-dimensional icon of a horizontal manila-colored folder with a white document partially emerging from its top opening.

**Detailed description of the image content, structure, elements, and meaning:**

The main element is a standard desktop folder icon, rendered with a modern, somewhat glossy aesthetic. The folder is oriented horizontally and is predominantly colored in shades of yellow-orange or golden-brown, suggesting a classic manila folder. It features a visible top flap that is slightly darker, creating an opening. The folder's body shows gradients and highlights, giving it a three-dimensional, rounded appearance, with lighter tones on the upper surfaces and darker, shadowed areas along the bottom and internal folds. This shading suggests a light source from the top-left.

Emerging from the top-right section of the folder's opening is a single sheet of paper or document. This document is white or off-white and has faint, parallel horizontal blue lines across its visible surface, indicating text or ruled paper. The top-right corner of this document is folded over, creating a dog-eared effect, and revealing an orange or light brown underside, which matches the general color palette of the folder itself.

The icon is set against a transparent or neutral background, indicating it is a standalone graphical element designed for user interfaces. The overall impression is that of a container (the folder) holding information (the document), commonly used in computing to represent directories or collections of files.
