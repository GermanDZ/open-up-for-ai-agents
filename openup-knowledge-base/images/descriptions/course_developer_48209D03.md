# Image Description: course_developer_48209D03.jpg

**Alt Text:** Course_Developer

## Description

This image displays a simple diagram on a white background, illustrating responsibilities and actions related to course development. The diagram contains three main visual elements connected by lines with textual labels.

**High-Level Description:**

The diagram depicts a "Course Developer" actor interacting with an activity "Develop Training Materials" and being responsible for an artifact "Training Materials". It's a conceptual model showing the role, an action performed by that role, and the output of that action.

**Detailed Description of Elements and Relationships:**

1. **Actor/Role:**
   - On the left side of the diagram, there is a stylized stick figure icon, commonly used to represent an actor or user in diagrams like UML use case diagrams.
   - Below this icon, the text label "Course Developer" identifies the role or entity represented. The icon itself is a light brown/gold color.

2. **Activity/Process:**
   - To the upper right of the "Course Developer", there is a gold-colored, flag-shaped icon. This shape often signifies an activity, task, or process in diagrams.
   - Adjacent to this icon, the text label "Develop Training Materials" clearly names the activity.

3. **Artifact/Output:**
   - To the lower right of the "Course Developer", a document icon is present. This icon typically represents a document, file, or artifact.
   - Next to this icon, the text label "Training Materials" identifies the specific artifact. The icon shows multiple horizontal lines, suggesting text or content on a page.

4. **Relationships:**
   - **"performs" relationship:** A diagonal line extends from the "Course Developer" (specifically, from its top-right side) upwards towards the "Develop Training Materials" activity. The line is labeled "performs", indicating that the "Course Developer" carries out or executes the "Develop Training Materials" activity.
   - **"responsible for" relationship:** Another diagonal line extends from the "Course Developer" (from its bottom-right side) downwards towards the "Training Materials" artifact. This line is labeled "responsible for", signifying that the "Course Developer" is accountable for the "Training Materials".

**Overall Meaning:**

The diagram visually communicates that a "Course Developer" is the entity (or role) that "performs" the action of "Develop Training Materials" and is ultimately "responsible for" the resulting "Training Materials". It outlines a fundamental role, its key activity, and the primary output associated with that role.
