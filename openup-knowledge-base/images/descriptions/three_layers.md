# Image Description: three_layers.jpg

## Description

This image is a diagram illustrating a hierarchical and iterative software development process, broken down into three main lifecycles: Micro-Increment, Iteration Lifecycle, and Project Lifecycle. Each lifecycle is associated with a different time scale and focus, emphasizing a layered approach to development.

The diagram is structured horizontally into three distinct bands, from top to bottom:

1. **Micro-Increment (Personal Focus):**
   - Located at the top, this section represents the shortest cycle, measured in "Days."
   - It shows a "Work Item" document (represented by a stack of papers with lines) feeding into an "Increment" (depicted as a smaller cog or gear).
   - An arrow points from the "Work Item" upwards to the "Increment," suggesting the work item leads to an increment.
   - A curved arrow around the "Increment" gear indicates its cyclical nature.
   - This layer is labeled "Personal Focus" on the right.

2. **Iteration Lifecycle (Team Focus):**
   - The middle section, operating on a "Weeks" time scale.
   - It shows an "Iteration Plan" document (similar to the "Work Item" but lower) feeding into an "Iteration" (depicted as a larger cog or gear).
   - A long, thick, purple arrow points from the "Iteration Plan" upwards to the "Iteration," signifying that the plan drives the iteration.
   - The large "Iteration" gear is shown meshing with and driving the smaller "Increment" gear above it, illustrating that iterations are composed of multiple increments. Curved arrows around both gears indicate their continuous motion.
   - An arrow from the "Iteration" gear points to the right, leading to a "Demo-able or Shippable Build" (represented by a light brown cardboard box icon).
   - This layer is labeled "Team Focus" on the right.

3. **Project Lifecycle (Stakeholder Focus):**
   - The bottom section, representing the longest cycle, measured in "Months."
   - It starts with a "Project Plan" document (at the bottom left, similar to the other plan documents).
   - A purple arrow points from the "Project Plan" upwards, extending through the "Iteration Plan" to the "Work Item," indicating a hierarchical planning structure where the project plan informs iterations and individual work items.
   - To the right of the "Project Plan" is a timeline segmented into four phases: "Inception," "Elaboration," "Construction," and "Transition." These phases represent the typical stages of a project lifecycle.
   - Below this timeline, two curves are plotted against the project phases:
     - A red curve labeled "Risk" starts high during "Inception" and gradually decreases through "Elaboration" and "Construction," becoming very low by "Transition."
     - A green curve labeled "Value" starts low during "Inception" and gradually increases through "Elaboration" and "Construction," reaching its peak during "Transition."
   - This layer is labeled "Stakeholder Focus" on the right.

Overall, the diagram visually represents an agile or iterative development model where smaller, frequent increments combine to form iterations, which in turn contribute to the overall project lifecycle. It highlights how planning flows upwards from project to individual tasks, and how risk decreases while value increases over the project's duration. The use of gears effectively conveys continuous, interconnected processes.
