## Description

This image is a horizontal process flow diagram, illustrating a sequence of four distinct phases in a development or project lifecycle.

**High-level description:**

The diagram presents a linear progression from a starting point to an end point, moving left to right, through four key phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition. Each phase is represented by an icon and text label, connected by directional arrows.

**Detailed description:**

1. **Start Node:** The process begins on the far left with a solid blue circle, commonly representing an initial state or start event in a flow diagram.

2. **Flow Connectors:** Unidirectional black arrows connect all elements sequentially, indicating the flow and order of the phases.

3. **Phase Representation:** Each of the four phases is depicted using an identical icon positioned above its corresponding text label. The icon consists of a blue rectangular base, topped by several undulating, layered shapes in shades of light blue, pink, and orange/yellow, resembling stacked documents, data layers, or a stylized building block structure.

4. **Phases (from left to right):**
   - **Inception Phase:** The first phase, labeled "Inception Phase", immediately follows the start node.
   - **Elaboration Phase:** Connected by an arrow from the "Inception Phase", this phase is labeled "Elaboration Phase".
   - **Construction Phase:** Following the "Elaboration Phase" via an arrow, this phase is labeled "Construction Phase".
   - **Transition Phase:** The final named phase, labeled "Transition Phase", is connected by an arrow from the "Construction Phase".

5. **End Node:** The process concludes on the far right with a blue circle outlined in black, which contains a smaller solid blue circle. This represents a final state or end event, signifying the completion of the overall process.

The diagram's clean, simple layout emphasizes the sequential nature of these project phases.
