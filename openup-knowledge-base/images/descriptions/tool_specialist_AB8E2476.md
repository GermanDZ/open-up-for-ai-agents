**Alt Text:** Tool_Specialist

## Description

This image is a simple diagram illustrating the roles and responsibilities of a "Tool Specialist" within a system or process.

**High-Level Description:**

The diagram depicts a "Tool Specialist" actor connected to two actions they "perform" and one artifact they are "responsible for." It visually outlines key activities and ownership related to tools.

**Detailed Description:**

1. **Central Actor:** On the left side of the diagram, a generic "person" or "actor" icon (a stylized stick figure) is depicted in a light brown/tan color. This icon is labeled "Tool Specialist" beneath it.

2. **Performs Actions:** Two diagonal lines extend upwards and to the right from the "Tool Specialist" icon. Both lines are labeled with the text "performs".
   - The upper line points to a flag-shaped or bent-document icon, also in light brown/tan, labeled "Set Up Tools".
   - The lower line points to another identical flag-shaped icon, labeled "Verify Tool Configuration and Installation". The label for this second action is split into two lines for readability.

3. **Responsible For Artifact:** A single diagonal line extends downwards and to the right from the "Tool Specialist" icon. This line is labeled with the text "responsible for".
   - This line points to a document icon (a rectangle with a folded top-right corner and horizontal lines suggesting text), colored light blue and white. This icon is labeled "Tools".

**Relationships and Meaning:**

The diagram clearly establishes that the "Tool Specialist" is the primary agent who undertakes the tasks of "Set Up Tools" and "Verify Tool Configuration and Installation." Furthermore, the "Tool Specialist" holds responsibility for the "Tools" themselves, implying ownership or stewardship over the tools and their lifecycle. The visual structure is straightforward, using common UML-like activity or actor notation to convey process and role relationships.
