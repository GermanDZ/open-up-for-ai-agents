## Description

This image displays a process flow diagram, commonly used in software engineering or systems development, illustrating the progression from initial requirements to working software through a series of mechanisms.

**High-Level Description:**

The diagram shows a linear flow starting with "Requirements Analysis" and culminating in "Working Software". It depicts three main stages or "mechanisms": Analysis, Design, and Implementation, connected by arrows labeled with the actions or states that bridge them.

**Detailed Description:**

1. **Start Node:** The process begins on the far left with a solid gray circle, which typically represents an initial state or start node in a flow diagram. This node is labeled "Requirements Analysis identified", indicating that the starting point is when requirements have been identified.

2. **Analysis Mechanism:** An arrow extends from the start node to the first rectangular box with rounded corners, labeled "Analysis Mechanism". This box represents the stage where analysis takes place.

3. **Transition to Design:** From "Analysis Mechanism," an arrow points to the right towards the next stage. This arrow is labeled "concrete", suggesting that the output of the analysis mechanism becomes concrete and forms the input for the design phase.

4. **Design Mechanism:** The second rectangular box with rounded corners is labeled "Design Mechanism", indicating the stage where the system design is carried out based on the concrete analysis.

5. **Transition to Implementation:** An arrow extends from "Design Mechanism" to the third stage. This arrow is labeled "specified", implying that the design is now specified and ready for implementation.

6. **Implementation Mechanism:** The third rectangular box with rounded corners is labeled "Implementation Mechanism", representing the stage where the specified design is built into code or other deliverables.

7. **End Node:** Finally, an arrow labeled "implemented" leads from "Implementation Mechanism" to a double-lined gray circle on the far right, which is labeled "Working Software". This double-lined circle typically signifies a final state or completion node, indicating that the implementation results in functional software.

In essence, the diagram illustrates a waterfall-like or sequential software development process, where requirements lead to analysis, which informs design, and finally culminates in the implementation of working software. Each arrow label ("identified", "concrete", "specified", "implemented") denotes a state change or an outcome that enables progression to the subsequent mechanism.
