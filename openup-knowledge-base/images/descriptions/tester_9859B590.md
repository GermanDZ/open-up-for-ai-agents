**Alt Text:** Tester

## Description

This image is a simple diagram illustrating the activities performed by a "Tester" and the artifacts they are responsible for, likely within a software development or quality assurance context. It functions as a conceptual map, defining the scope of a Tester's roles.

**High-Level Description:**

The diagram depicts a central figure, labeled "Tester," connected to two distinct categories of elements: actions they "performs" and documents they are "responsible for." The "performs" category lists three activities, while the "responsible for" category lists three types of documents.

**Detailed Description:**

1. **Central Figure (Actor):**
   - On the left side of the diagram, there is a stick-figure icon representing a person, labeled "Tester" beneath it. This icon typically symbolizes an actor or a role in a system.

2. **Branches and Relationships:**
   - Two lines extend from the "Tester" figure, diverging upwards and downwards:
     - The upper branch is labeled "performs".
     - The lower branch is labeled "responsible for".

3. **"Performs" Activities:**
   - Connected to the "performs" branch are three identical rectangular shapes with an angled top-right corner, resembling activity or process symbols, arranged horizontally:
     - The first shape is labeled "Create Test Cases".
     - The second shape is labeled "Implement Tests".
     - The third shape is labeled "Run Tests".
   - These elements represent the actions or tasks a Tester carries out.

4. **"Responsible For" Artifacts:**
   - Connected to the "responsible for" branch are three identical document-like icons (a rectangle with a folded top-right corner, resembling a piece of paper), also arranged horizontally:
     - The first document is labeled "Test Case".
     - The second document is labeled "Test Log".
     - The third document is labeled "Test Script".
   - These elements represent the outputs, deliverables, or records that a Tester is accountable for.

**Overall Meaning and Context:**

The diagram illustrates a clear division of the Tester's role: they are actively involved in the creation, implementation, and execution phases of testing, and they are responsible for the documentation that defines (Test Case, Test Script) and records (Test Log) these activities. This implies a structured approach to testing where roles and responsibilities are well-defined.
