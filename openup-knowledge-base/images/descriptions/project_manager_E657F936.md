# Image Description: project_manager_E657F936.jpg

**Alt Text:** Project_Manager

## Description

This image is a simple diagram illustrating the responsibilities and actions of a "Project Manager". It visually categorizes what a Project Manager "performs" and what they are "responsible for."

**High-Level Description:**

The diagram features a "Project Manager" as the central figure on the left, depicted by a golden-yellow stick figure icon. Two lines branch out from the Project Manager, labeled "performs" and "responsible for," leading to lists of activities and documents, respectively. The activities are represented by golden-yellow, arrow-shaped rectangular icons, while the documents are represented by light blue and white page icons with lines.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Project Manager:** On the far left, a stylized person icon (a golden-yellow stick figure) is labeled "Project Manager" directly below it. This indicates the primary role being described.

2. **"performs" branch:**
   - A line extends from the "Project Manager" upwards and to the right, splitting into multiple branches. The initial split is labeled "performs".
   - These branches connect to four distinct activity icons, arranged horizontally in the top row. Each icon is a golden-yellow rectangle with an arrow pointing to the right, symbolizing a process or activity.
   - The activities listed are:
     - "Assess Results"
     - "Manage Iteration"
     - "Plan Iteration"
     - "Plan Project"

3. **"responsible for" branch:**
   - Another line extends from the "Project Manager" downwards and to the right, also splitting into multiple branches. This initial split is labeled "responsible for".
   - These branches connect to four distinct document icons, arranged horizontally in the bottom row, directly below the activities. Each icon depicts a sheet of paper with several horizontal lines, representing a document or artifact.
   - The documents listed are:
     - "Iteration Plan"
     - "Project Plan"
     - "Risk List"
     - "Work Items List"

**Overall Meaning:**

The diagram effectively visualizes a functional breakdown of a Project Manager's role. It shows that a Project Manager is involved in strategic planning (Plan Project, Plan Iteration), operational management (Manage Iteration), evaluation (Assess Results), and is accountable for key project artifacts (Iteration Plan, Project Plan, Risk List, Work Items List). The layout is clear and straightforward, using simple, distinct icons and labels to convey information about roles and associated tasks/deliverables.
