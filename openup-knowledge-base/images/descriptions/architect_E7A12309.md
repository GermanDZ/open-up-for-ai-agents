# Image Description: architect_E7A12309.jpg

**Alt Text:** Architect

## Description

This image is a simplified diagram illustrating the responsibilities and actions of an "Architect" role within a process, likely related to software or system architecture.

**High-Level Description:**

The diagram shows a central figure, an "Architect," linked to two actions they "performs" and one artifact they are "responsible for." It depicts a clear, concise breakdown of an architect's involvement in architectural activities and documentation.

**Detailed Description:**

1. **The "Architect" Entity:**
   - On the left side of the diagram, a stick-figure icon with an arm raised (often used to represent a person or actor in diagrams) is labeled "Architect" directly below it. The icon is filled with a light brown/golden yellow color.

2. **Actions Performed by the Architect:**
   - Two diagonal lines extend upwards and rightwards from the "Architect" entity. Both lines are labeled "performs" where they branch off from the Architect.
   - The upper line points to a shape that resembles a rectangular flag or a document with a right-facing arrowhead, filled with the same light brown/golden yellow color. This shape is labeled "Envision the Architecture."
   - The lower line (from the "performs" branch) points to an identical flag/arrowhead shape, also filled in light brown/golden yellow, labeled "Refine the Architecture."
   - These two elements suggest that the Architect actively carries out the tasks of envisioning and refining the architectural design.

3. **Artifact the Architect is Responsible For:**
   - A third diagonal line extends downwards and rightwards from the "Architect" entity. This line is labeled "responsible for" where it branches off from the Architect.
   - This line points to an icon representing a document, which looks like a sheet of paper with lines on it (mimicking text), colored light blue with a darker blue border and text lines. This document icon is labeled "Architecture Notebook."
   - This indicates that the Architect is accountable for the "Architecture Notebook," presumably a document or collection of documents containing architectural details, decisions, and designs.

**Overall Meaning:**

The diagram visually represents that an "Architect" has two primary active roles: "Envision the Architecture" and "Refine the Architecture," and is also responsible for maintaining an "Architecture Notebook." It's a clear, concise visual summary of key architect responsibilities, potentially part of a larger process or role definition.
