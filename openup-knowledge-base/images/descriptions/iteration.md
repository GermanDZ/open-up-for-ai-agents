## Description

This image displays a 3D pie chart titled "Features and Function Usage." The chart is designed to illustrate the distribution of usage frequency for certain features or functions.

The pie chart is divided into five distinct slices, each representing a different usage frequency category and its corresponding percentage of the total:

1. **Never**: This is the largest slice, colored light blue/lavender, representing **45%** of the usage. It indicates that nearly half of the features/functions are never used.

2. **Rarely**: This slice is colored deep red/maroon and accounts for **19%** of the usage, suggesting a significant portion of features are used infrequently.

3. **Sometimes**: This slice is dark gray with a visible textured pattern (possibly cross-hatching or dots) and represents **16%** of the usage.

4. **Often**: This segment is light aqua/cyan and constitutes **13%** of the usage, indicating a moderate frequency of use.

5. **Always**: This is the smallest slice, colored dark purple, representing **7%** of the usage, showing that only a small fraction of features/functions are consistently used.

The chart's 3D perspective gives it a sense of depth, with the "Sometimes" and "Rarely" slices appearing closer to the viewer at the bottom of the chart. The percentages are clearly labeled next to their respective categories, providing a quantitative overview of feature and function adoption or utilization. The sum of the percentages is 45 + 19 + 16 + 13 + 7 = 100%, indicating a complete distribution.
