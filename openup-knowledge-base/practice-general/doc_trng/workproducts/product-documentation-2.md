Description

Main Description|  Product documentation is created for the benefit of the marketing arm of an organization, the program manager, and those people who must assess the business value of a particular system.  This is an often overlooked aspect of development team implementation. The team should consider that the customers of a particular release usually are not technical themselves, but do require a detailed enough understanding of how their product operates and how it meets stated business goals and needs.
