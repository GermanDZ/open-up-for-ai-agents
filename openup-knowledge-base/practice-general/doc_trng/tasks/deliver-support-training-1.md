Main Description

Because a release ultimately will have to be supported by Help Desk or other technical personnel, a set of training materials designed to convey key concepts to those individuals must be developed and delivered by the development team or by a technically oriented trainer.  Delivery of this training might include presentation slides, job aids, lab exercises, or workshops designed to provide real-world scenarios to accelerate learning and retention. In addition, the training materials might be different for each level \(tier\) of support.
---

Steps

Validate support training logistics |  Before actually delivering the training to support personnel, ensure that you have all the necessary components of the training course, including:
  * Presentation slides
  * Handouts
  * Training aids
  * Hands-on labs and/or exercises
  * Quizzes or tests
  * Feedback and/or instructor assessment forms

Ensure that the classes have been scheduled correctly and that attendees have been identified. Also, validate that the facilities where you will deliver the training have been properly booked and are furnished to accommodate the training content and audience. If possible, send a reminder notice to the attendees several days \(or a week\) before the delivery date.
---

Prepare for support training delivery

Review the training materials so that you are familiar with them. If you encounter any areas where you are unsure or tentative, engage experts from the development team or program who can help you understand the material. Then, update the training materials accordingly and create instructor notes to help you remember key points as you deliver the training. Instructor notes that you write will not only help you but might assist other instructors in the future who have not had the benefit of working with the development team or program.
---

deliver support training and gather feedback

On the prescribed day\(s\) and time\(s\), deliver the training as planned. When each course is completed, solicit feedback from the attendees about the course material, its organization and flow, the learning objectives, how well the instructor delivered the content, and whether the course met their expectations.
---

Provide feedback to the program

Consolidate the feedback from the courses delivered and provide it to the program manager or their delegate for review.
