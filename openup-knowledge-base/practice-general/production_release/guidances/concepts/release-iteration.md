 A Release Iteration/Sprint \(sometimes called a Hardening Iteration/Sprint\) is one in which no new features are developed; rather, other activities that add value to the product are performed before its release.
---

Main Description

Typical activities that occur during a Release Sprint/Iteration include:
  * Removing accrued technical debt
  * Fixing critical and major defects
  * Finalizing integrations to other systems
  * Documenting various aspects of the product, including support and user documentation
  * Significant functional, performance, load, system, user acceptance, and integration testing
  * Training support personnel and end users
  * Drafting an Implementation Plan and/or Deployment Plan

Sometimes development teams will split into two - one subteam works on release hardening activities, while the other works in parallel using a separate stream, developing new features for a follow-on release.
