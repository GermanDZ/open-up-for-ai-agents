Main Description

Steps

Validate the communiques | Ensure that the communiques designated for this release are correct, complete, and reflect all the stakeholder groups that must be informed.
---

Send release communications

Using a pre-planned script, send the communiques in the manner designated in the [Artifact: Release Communications](../workproducts/release-communications-4.md). Most of the time, the preferred communication mechanism will be by email, but other methods could include beeper notification, telephone calls, a posting to an internal release website, live or pre-recorded presentations by senior management, etc.
---

Validate communications were received

If the communiques were sent by email, it may be prudent to request a receipt of delivery to ensure that the notices were received by the intended audience.
