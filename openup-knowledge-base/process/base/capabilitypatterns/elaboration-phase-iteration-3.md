 This iteration template defines the activities \(and associated roles and work products\) performed in a typical iteration in the Elaboration phase.

Description

Most activities during a typical iteration in Elaboration phase happen in parallel. Essentially, the main objectives for Elaboration are related to better understanding the requirements, creating and establishing a baseline of the architecture for the system, and mitigating top-priority risks.  The following table summarizes the Elaboration phase objectives and what activities address each objective:  **Elaboration phase objectives and activities** |  **Phase objectives** |  **Activities that address objectives**

Get a more detailed understanding of the requirements  |  [Identify and Refine Requirements](identify-and-refine-requirements-1.md)
Design, implement, validate, and baseline an architecture  |  [Develop the Architecture](develop-the-architecture-2.md) [Develop Solution Increment](develop-solution-increment-2.md) [Test Solution](test-solution-2.md)
Mitigate essential risks, and produce accurate schedule and cost estimates  |  [Plan and Manage Iteration](plan-and-manage-iteration-12.md)

Alternatives

There will be iterations when projects risks are being addressed by creating software, but they may not be architecturally significant. In this case, [Develop Solution Increment](develop-solution-increment-2.md) will be performed outside the context of the architecture. For the most part, Develop Solution will be performed in the context of [Develop the Architecture](develop-the-architecture-2.md) during the Elaboration phase.
