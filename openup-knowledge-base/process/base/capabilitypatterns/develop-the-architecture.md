Description

This activity refines the initial high-level architecture into working software. The objective is to produce stable software that adequately addresses the technical risks in scope.  The architect and developers work together to:
  * Refine the initial sketch of the architecture into concrete design elements
  * Ensure that the architecture decisions are adequately captured and communicated
  * Ensure that the team has enough information to enable software to be developed
  * Ensure that the requirements that were prioritized for the current iteration are adequately addressed in the software

In an iterative project, the team should not attempt to develop the architecture for the entire project in a single pass. Rather, they should focus on meeting the requirements in scope for the current iteration, while making decisions in the context of the wider project.
