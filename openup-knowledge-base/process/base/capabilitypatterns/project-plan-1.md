Main Description

This artifact describes how the project is organized, and identifies what practices will be followed. Additionally, it defines the parameters for tracking project progress, and specifies the high-level objectives of the iterations and their milestones.  The project plan allows stakeholders and other team members to understand the big picture and, roughly, when to expect a certain level of functionality be available. Update the plan as often as necessary, usually at the end of each iteration, in order to reflect changing priorities and needs, as well as record the lessons learned from the project.

Tailoring

Impact of not having| Without this artifact, there can be a lack of clear boundaries of the project scope that can lead to:
  * Risks of gaps or overlap between the roles acting on the project
  * Poorly defined or inadequate plan for the project
  * Subsequent difficulties in controlling the project
---|---
Reasons for not needing| This artifact is typically required in some form on all but the smallest projects. However, projects taking a purely evolutionary or maintenance approach to development may choose to omit this artifact.
