 This task describes how to detail a use-case scenarios for the system.
---

Purpose

The purpose of this task is to describe use-case scenarios in sufficient detail to validate understanding of the requirements, to ensure concurrence with stakeholder expectations, and to permit software development to begin.

Steps

Detail use cases and scenarios |  Some use cases and scenarios might need to be described in more detail to validate the understanding of the requirements and to permit software development to begin. This does not imply that all use cases and scenarios will be detailed prior to commencing implementation on them. The level of detail captured will vary depending upon the needs of the project and the complexity of the use case. Capture the use case and scenarios details in the use case specification.
---

Detail glossary terms

Review the flow of the use case or scenario. If information is exchanged, be specific about what is passed back and forth. Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure that you define newly discovered domain terms, or ambiguous terms properly in the glossary. If your understanding of the domain has improved, refine existing glossary terms.
---

Achieve concurrence

Review the detailed use case and scenarios with relevant stakeholders and the development team to ensure consistency with the agreed vision. Assess quality and identify any required changes.
---

Update Use-Case Model

Based on your work detailing use cases and scenarios, update the [Use-Case Model](../../../core/common/workproducts/use-case-model.md). Add, remove or update [Actors](../../../core/common/guidances/concepts/actor.md) and [Use Case](../../../core/common/workproducts/use-case.md)s as required.
For more information on creating and structuring your use case model see [Guideline: Use-Case Model](../../../practice-technical/use_case_driven_dev/guidances/guidelines/use-case-model-9.md). For assistance in assessing the quality of your use-case model see [Checklist: Use-Case Model](../../../core/common/guidances/checklists/use-case-model-1.md).

Key Considerations

To avoid unnecessary rework, only those use-case scenarios that are scheduled for implementation in the near term \(in the next iteration or two\) must be detailed.  Not all use-case scenarios require detailing.
