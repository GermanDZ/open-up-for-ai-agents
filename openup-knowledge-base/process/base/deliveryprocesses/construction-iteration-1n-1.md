Description

The architecture should be stable when the Construction phase starts, allowing the remaining requirements to be implemented on top of it. Another advantage of validating the architecture and eliminating as many risks as possible during Elaboration is that it provides more predictability in Construction, which allows the project manager to focus on team efficiency and cost reduction.  Functionality is continuously implemented, tested, and integrated, resulting in builds that are more and more complete and stable. You may deploy a beta or prerelease to a sampling of the intended audience at the end of Construction. Delivery of the actual release is the main focus of the next phase.  The following table summarizes the Construction phase objectives and what activities address each objective:  **Construction phase objectives and activities** |  **Phase objectives** |  **Activities that address objectives**
