 This delivery process defines an end-to-end software development lifecycle that supports the core principles of OpenUP. It is designed to support small, co-located teams in their daily activities.
---

Purpose

This delivery process is intended to:
  * Promote collaboration \(both internal and external to the team\), to align interests and share understanding
  * Help the team focus on the architecture early, to minimize risks and organize development
  * Help the team balance competing priorities to maximize stakeholder value
  * Help the team evolve the product to continuously obtain feedback and improve
  * Allow project managers to track status based on goals
  * Allow team members to understand how to perform their work to achieve project goals

Description

OpenUP is an iterative process with [iterations](../../../guides/base/guidances/concepts/evolve-to-continuously-obtain-feedback-and-improve.md) distributed throughout four phases: [Inception](../../../practice-management/risk_value_lifecycle/guidances/concepts/inception-phase-10.md), [Elaboration](../../../practice-management/risk_value_lifecycle/guidances/concepts/elaboration-phase-10.md), [Construction](../../../practice-management/risk_value_lifecycle/guidances/concepts/construction-phase-10.md), and [Transition](../../../practice-management/risk_value_lifecycle/guidances/concepts/transition-phase-10.md).  Each phase may have as many iterations as needed \(depending on the degree of novelty of the business domain, the technology being used, architectural complexity, and project size, to name a few factors\).  To offer a quick start for teams to plan their iterations, OpenUP provides work breakdown structure \(WBS\) templates for each iteration, and a WBS template for an end-to-end process.  Iterations may have variable lengths, depending on project characteristics. One-month iterations are typically recommended, because this timeframe provides:
  * A reasonable amount of time for projects to deliver meaningful increments in functionality.
  * Early and frequent customer feedback.
  * Timely management of risks and issues during the course of the project.

OpenUP is intended to offer process guidance to small, co-located teams.
