Check Items

Have Work Items been described without ambiguity? |  Does each Work Item have a name and clear description? This helps the team estimate Work Item size. If necessary, include links on the Work Items List to reference material where further detail is available.
---

Have Work Items been prioritized?

Has every Work Item been prioritized? This helps the team select the Work Items to be delivered in each iteration.
---

Have Work Items been estimated?

Every Work Item should be estimated. This will help the team to select the Work Items to be delivered in each iteration.
---

Are the Work Items being tracked?

Does every Work Item have a state attribute? This helps the team track its development project.
---

Are scheduled Work Items the right size?

If a Work Item is scheduled for an iteration, then it should be broken down into Work Items that can be completed in a reasonable timeframe, from a few hours to a few days \(micro-increments\). This will help the team be more productive and produce more detailed effort estimates.
