####  1.5

This is the initial release of the practices library, which is included as part of the Eclipse Process Framework \(EPF\) 1.5.  Most of the open source content derives from OpenUP 1.0, refactored to support independent practices.  These are the key new features in the core:
  * Work product slots to allow practices to be independent of each other.
  * Default navigation view that _ad hoc_ configurations of practices can be published easily with a view.
  * Guidance and work products reusable across practices have been moved into common plug-ins.
  * Category, role, and tool definitions separated into separate plug-ins to allow them to be easily removed and replaced by alternative categorizations.
