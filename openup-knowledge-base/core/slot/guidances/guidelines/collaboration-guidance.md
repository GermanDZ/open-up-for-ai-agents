Main Description

Effective communication and collaboration among the whole team are important aspects of successful projects, no matter the size of the project or methodology followed by the team. The whole team \(including customers, developers, managers, quality assurance team, technical writers, and everyone else involved with the project\) collaborates with one purpose in mind: to achieve the goals for a project, delivering the results of a project on time and within budget. The whole team collaborates and constantly communicates on what the goals are and how they will be attained. [\[POL08\]](./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#POL08) This guideline is a placeholder for collaboration guidelines contributed by other practices.
