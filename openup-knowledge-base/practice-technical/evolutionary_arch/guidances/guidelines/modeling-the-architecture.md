Main Description

When architecting a system, developing visual models of the architecture can be quite helpful as such models provide an excellent high-level picture of the system, its [Component](../../../../core/common/guidances/concepts/component.md)s and their relationships. Specifically, you may find it useful to develop these three Unified Modeling Language \(UML\) diagrams:
  * **Layer map** \(represented as a class diagram using packages\) that describes the upper-level layers of the architecture
  * **Deployment diagram** \(represented by a deployment diagram\) that outlines the expected network topology
  * **Key Abstractions diagram** \(represented by a class diagram\) that shows the key abstractions/components and important relationships among them
