 Four core principles capture the general intentions behind OpenUP. They create the foundation for interpreting roles and work products, and for performing tasks.

Main Description

OpenUP is based on four mutually supporting core principles.

#####  Balance competing priorities to maximize stakeholder value

> Promote practices that allow project participants and stakeholders to develop a solution that maximizes stakeholder benefits, and is compliant with constraints placed on the project.
>  See [Balance](../guidances/concepts/balance-competing-priorities-to-maximize-stakeholder-value.md) core principle for more information.

#####  Collaborate to align interests and share understanding

> Promote practices that foster a healthy team environment, enable collaboration and develop a shared understanding of the project.
>  See [Collaborate](../guidances/concepts/collaborate-to-align-interests-and-share-understanding.md) core principle for more information.

#####  Focus on the architecture early to minimize risks and organize development

> Promote practices that allow the team to focus on architecture to minimize risks and organize development.
>  See [Focus](../guidances/concepts/focus-on-the-architecture-early-to-minimize-risks-and-organize-development.md) core principle for more information.

#####  Evolve to continuously obtain feedback and improve

> Promote practices that allow the team to get early and continuous feedback from stakeholders, and demonstrate incremental value to them.
>  See [Evolve](../guidances/concepts/evolve-to-continuously-obtain-feedback-and-improve.md) core principle for more information.
