Purpose

At any time, any member of the team may uncover defects or propose new requirements that are not in scope for the iteration. There should be some process for tracking such requests, so that they do not get lost. This practice simply captures such requests as work items, and assumes that work item management practices will address the acceptance, assignment, verification, and closure of such requests.

Main Description

This practice describes the simplest possible change management approach, one in which change management is an integral part of project management. In this approach, any one may request a change to the system \(or supporting artifacts\) at any time, either to correct a defect identified or to add an enhancement. The request for change is captured on the backlog of outstanding \[Project Work\]. During project planning the team reviews the backlog, prioritizes work and decides which changes will be implemented next.

How to read this practice

The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what is in it and how it is organized.  Review the task: [Request Change](../../tasks/request-change-1.md) and associated guidance. Next, review the Iterative Development practice to understand how change requests are captured and managed on the [Work Items List](../../../../core/common/workproducts/work-items-list-6.md).  For step-by-step instructions on how to adopt this practice, see [How to Adopt the Team Change Management Practice](../roadmaps/how-to-adopt-the-team-change-management-practice.md).
