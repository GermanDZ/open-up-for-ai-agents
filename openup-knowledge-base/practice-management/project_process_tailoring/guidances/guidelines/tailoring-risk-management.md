Main Description

For a given process area, you may need to refine or adapt the organizational process to accommodate your project needs. The following are typical activities and key considerations when tailoring the Risk Management process area for your project:
  * Refine the approach to be used to identify risks, and how risks will be analyzed and prioritized.
  * Refine the list of potential sources of risk, as well as typical risk categories, and impacted stakeholders, which will help the team identify risks for the project.
  * Refine or adapt the risk management strategies that will be used in your project, including mitigation, avoidance, and/or prevention strategies for the most significant \("Top 10"\) risks.
  * Refine how the status of each significant risk and its mitigation activities will be monitored. Refine the acceptability thresholds against which risks will be periodically compared in order to determine the need for implementing a risk mitigation plan. Refine how risk review and reporting schedules will happen, and what frequency of reviews your project requires.
  * List specific groups or individuals involved in the project's risk management activities for your project, and provide a description of the tasks and responsibilities of each.
  * Specify the budget available in your project for managing project risks \(when this information is not already included in the overall project budget\).
  * List tools and techniques that will be used in your project to store risk information, evaluate risks, track the status of risks or generate risk management reports.
  * List the risk items that have been identified in your project. Decide if this will be a link to a separate Risk List artifact for the project or not. Publish and keep visible a "Top 10" list of risks that are considered significant enough for the project to spend resources on their management.
