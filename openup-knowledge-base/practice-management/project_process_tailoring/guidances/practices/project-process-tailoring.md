Purpose

The purpose of this practice is to guide the project team on tailoring and deploying the process to be followed by the team. The team also makes decisions such as how to use work products, what the project-specific guidelines are, and so on. The tools to support the project are installed, configured, and used by the team.

How to read this practice

The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what it is in it and how it is organized.  The best place to start is with the **Key Concepts** for the practice: those concepts that are critical to understand in order to adopt the practice. Once you understand the key concepts, you can turn your attention to the **Work Products** produced by the practice. Then you can review the practices **Tasks**. From the work products and the tasks, you can access applicable guidance: guidelines and tool mentors associated with each task provide details about how to perform the task. Templates and checklists associated with the work products guide you in their completion and evaluation. You can also access the guidance provided by the practice directly, via the **Guidance** folder.
